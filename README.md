# CS 330 Coding Project - A Security Device
Damien Karpen's (A20506154) super awesome CS 330 coding project. This project was extremely tedious for me because I am not an avid coder like most of the class is and my coding skills are extremely lacking. I was/am very annoyed how this project was sprung up at the request of a single student and that it is worth 10% of my grade.

What the program does:

+ The program will generate random numbers in an attempt to find the correct locking or unlocking sequence. In this case, the locking sequence is 061541, and the unlocking sequence is 061544. If either sequence is found, the program will say "unlocked" or "locked" depending on which sequence was found.
